Temperature Converter (Celsius to Fahrenheit)
How it works:

The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the web page with a title, input field for Celsius temperature, a "Submit" button, and a div to display the result.

The CSS file styles the elements to make the interface visually appealing.

The Javascript converts the Fahrenheit to celsius and vice vera.

It then performs the temperature conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.

When a user enters a value in Celsius and clicks the "Submitt" button, the application will instantly display the equivalent Fahrenheit temperature.
